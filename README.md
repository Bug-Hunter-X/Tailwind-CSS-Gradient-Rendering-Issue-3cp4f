# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients where the specified gradient direction might not produce the expected visual result depending on the element's dimensions. This is especially true for gradients applied to very narrow or small elements.  The issue is that a gradient specified to go from left to right in a narrow element can be hard to see, or even appear as a solid color. The solution involves carefully considering the gradient direction relative to the element size, and potentially using alternative techniques if needed.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the rendering of the gradient on the narrow div.

## Solution:

The solution involves careful consideration of the gradient direction and the element's dimensions.  If you need a gradient in a narrow element, a vertical gradient (`bg-gradient-to-b`) might be more suitable.  Additionally, consider using alternative techniques such as background images or custom CSS solutions if the gradient isn't visibly clear.
