```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This updated code uses `bg-gradient-to-b` (bottom) which is more suitable for narrow elements. Alternatively you could increase the width of the element or explore using a background image for better visual clarity.
