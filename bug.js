```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code might produce an unexpected visual output or even fail to render correctly if there's a mismatch between the specified gradient direction and the element's dimensions.  For example, using `bg-gradient-to-r` (right) on a very narrow div might result in a gradient that's barely visible or appears as a solid color.
